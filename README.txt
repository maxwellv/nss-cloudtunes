Max and Peder, I sent out an email yesterday, seems like Max your email
is either wrong on the contact list, or I made a mistake, but either way
it says invalid email address. Here is the link to the Trello I made to
help us:

https://trello.com/b/VRHrdYys/cloud-tunes

If that doesn't work here is a list of things I know we need to do, please
add to it when you come across something:

  Done: Album addSong method
  Done: Album addCover method
  Done: Album insert method

Song needs to get artist ID sent to it from addSong form so the 
redirect will be able to work

Work on Css
Accordion to display songs
